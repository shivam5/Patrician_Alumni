				<h4>About <span>Patrician Brothers</span></h4>
				<p>The Patrician Brothers, or Brothers of Saint Patrick, are a Roman Catholic congregation for the religious and literary education of youth and the instruction of the faithful in Christian piety.</p><br>

				<p>This Brotherhood was founded by the Right Rev. Dr. Daniel Delany, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, at Tullow, County Carlow, Ireland, on the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in 1808. Religious toleration of Catholics and dissenters by the Irish Parliament since 1782, was followed by was the restoration of the franchise in 1793, and the Maynooth Grant. The Act of Union in 1801, followed with the promise of Catholic Emancipation. Roman Catholics in Britain and Ireland were emerging from the punitive Penal Laws, which since 1728 had forbidden religious run schools which supported Roman Catholic doctrine and its practices.</p><br>

				<p>Bishop Delaney set to founding the Religious Congregation of the Brothers of Saint Patrick in his diocese, for this purpose. He chose from among the catechetical instructors of the diocesan Sunday schools seven young men who formed the nucleus of the new order. Under the personal instruction of the bishop, and the direction of his successor, Dr.Doyle, the congregation was established as a diocesan institution.</p><br>

				<p>In succeeding years, branches were established in other dioceses of Ireland, and the Brothers were invited by several Australian and Indian bishops to erect schools these countries. Several foundations were made, among them those of Sydney, to which archdiocese the Brothers were invited by Cardinal Moran; and that of Madras in India, undertaken at the request of Bishop Stephen Fennelly.</p><br>

				<p>In 1885 the Brothers made application to the Holy See for the approval of the congregation, to constitute a central governance board and to establish a common novitiate. Sounding opinions from the bishops in whose dioceses the Brothers were established, Pope Leo XIII provisionally approved the congregation for five years by a Rescript dated 6 January 1888, and on 8 September 1893, issued a decree of final confirmation. This included approving their rules and constitution, the facilities and powers necessary for their congregation, constituting India and Australia separate provinces. The governance of the order, which had functioned as separate communities, were united. The superior general four assistants governs the congregation, at the mother-house, Tullow, Co. Carlow, Ireland, where there is a novitiate and a house of studies.</p><br>

				<p>A general chapter of the Patrician communities assembles every six years. As a result of the confirmation of the Institute the Brothers could extend their congregation in Ireland, and open new colleges, schools and orphanages.
				The scope of their work, which embraces primary, intermediate and university education, has been extended in recent years. The introduction of a scheme of technical and scientific study by the different educational departments was warmly supported by the Brotherhood; while by their management of orphanages and industrial schools they aid to life skills. Their residential colleges and secondary day-schools equip the students for adult life. The colleges of the Brothers in India were affiliated to the Allahabad and Calcutta Universities, in which their students distinguished themselves; while in Australia, They operate several schools.</p><br>

				<h4>Patricians <span>In India</span></h4>

				<p>In 1875, three Irish Patrician Brothers - Ignatius, Paul and Fintan - began their mission by taking care of the destitute and orphan boys of the Archdiocese of Madras. They founded the St. Patrick's High School and orphanage. Their strong faith enabled them to dedicate themselves to the primary object of their mission in those difficult days. <br><br>

					As time went on, the Brothers were able to extend their mission of educational apostolate to other parts of India. St Joseph's College, Coonoor (South India), a hill station, was started in 1892. The following year the Brothers took over St. George's College and St. Fidelis High School in Barlowganj, Mussoorie (North India) from the Capuchin Fathers. <br><br>

					The origins of St. Patrick's High School and Orphanage in Madras are outlined in the following historical quotation. <br><br>

					"The Institution continued till May 1856, when capitation grants were secured from Government and towards the end of 1863, a substantial two storeyed building was erected within the Church Compound with the aid of a government building grant. (This building is now St. Mary's High School for day pupils.) It was then discovered that the supervision was not as satisfactory as the Brothers of ST. Patrick (a religious community of vigilant and industrious Irish Monks) would have wished. The achievements of these worthy educationalists have been acknowledged by successive inspectors of schools. The institution cotinued to grow and develop and, in order to obtain more suitable and commodious premises in a better locality, the superiors of the Brothers went on a mission to Europe, America and Australia and succeeded in realising the large sum of nearly Rs. 27, 000/-. This success, together with the encouragement by Government for the support of the orphans and destitute children under the grant-in-aide code, enabled the managers to purchase the large property known as Shikar Bagh or Elphinstone Park - the residence of a former Governor - in South Adyar on 1st July 1884." <br><br>

					The Brothers established St. Anthony's High School, Lahore (Pakistan) in 1911. St. Joseph's Academy, Dehra Dun, was established in 1934 and that was followed by St. Michael's Academy, Madras in 1951 and St. Mary's Academy in Meerut in 1952. Mount St. Mary's School. Delhi was started in 1963. It was only in 1948 that St. Fidelis Orphanage was amalgamated with St. George's College in the same Campus in 1949.<br><br>

					In the early fifties an important development took place and that was the introduction of Indian candidates. Formation houses for the training of Indian candidates were set up in Coonoor, Madras and Mussoorie. In this connection special mention must be made of the work done by Bros. McEvoy, O'Brien, Henderson, Ritchie, Long and Coffey. <br><br>

					We run vernacular schools in Mussoorie, Binnaguri and Trichi and these schools are supported by the more prosperous schools. <br><br>

					Brothers also run the National Open School stream to cater for the needs of students who are not able to cope with the normal grade system, as well as over aged children. On keeping with the options for the poor, there is a drive on to open more vernacular schools in the remote villages in the country. These need a great deal of financial support. At the present time, more and more religious people are moving out into village areas to be of help to the marginalised and less privileged and to stand for the cause of peace and justice.<br><br>
